# During the analysis for finding the cause of the error, we typically examine
# a "bad token" identified by Python as the cause of the error and often
# look at its two neighbours. If the bad token is the first one in a statement
# it does not have a token preceding it; if it is the last one, it does not
# have a token following it. By assigning a meaningless token value to these
# neighbours, the code for the analysis can be greatly simplified as we do
# not have to verify the existence of these neighbours.

class Statement:
    """Instances of this class contain all relevant information required
    for the various functions that attempt to determine the cause of
    SyntaxError.

    One main idea is to retrieve a "complete statement" where the
    exception is raised. By "complete statement", we mean the smallest
    number of consecutive lines of code that contains the line where
    the exception was raised and includes matching pairs of brackets,
    (), [], {}. If a problem arises due to non-matching pairs of brackets,
    this information is available (variables begin_brackets or end_bracket).

    A complete statement is saved as a list of tokens (statement_tokens)
    from which it could be reconstructed using an untokenize function.

    From this list of tokens, a secondary list is obtained (tokens) by
    removing all space-like and comment tokens, which are the only
    meaningful tokens needed to do the analysis.

    To simplify the code doing the error analysis itself, we precompute various
    parameters (e.g. does the statement fits on a single line, how many
    meaningful tokens are included, what are the first and last tokens
    on that statement, etc.) which are needed for some functions.
