"""This module look for various errors in the entire source.

Most of these errors are connected with parenthesis, (),
square brackets, [], and curly brackets, {}.

The type of errors it can look for are:

    1. mismatched brackets
    2. missing closing bracket
    3. missing comma between items.
    4. using = instead of : in a dict


This module started with a single function, which grew as it tried to figure out
the cause of the SyntaxError in a single pass through the source code.
While this might be more "efficient", it made the logic a lot more
difficult to understand.

In the interest of simplicity, extensibility and maintainability,
we now have multiple functions, some of which have almost identical
chunks of code.
