"""formatters.py

Default formatters showing all or only part of the available information.

A formatter is a function that takes two arguments::

1. a dict (named ``info`` everywhere in friendly-traceback files) containing
   all the information that can be shown to the user, as well as some
   entries that are meant to be used only internally as the full
   friendly-traceback information is obtained.

2. A second argument which is meant to convey what information should be shown.
   This second argument used to be a single integer ("verbosity level").
   It is currently recently being replaced by a string. However,
   this might change as we experiment with various options prior to
   version 1.0

A formatter returns a single string. By default, this string will be
written to stderr; however this can be changed by the calling program.

This module currently contains 4 formatters:

* ``repl()``: This is used to print the information in a traditional console,
  including that found in IDLE.  The indentation of the traceback itself
  is chosen so as to reproduce that of a normal Python traceback.

* ``pre()``: this produces output with leading spaces so that it can be
  embedded as a code-block in a file (such as .rst). It can also be used
  to print the information in a traditional console, including that
  found in IDLE.

* ``markdown()``: This produces an output formatted with markdown syntax.

* ``markdown_docs()``: This produces an output formatted markdown syntax,
    but where each header is shifted down by 2 (h1 -> h3, etc.) so that they
    can be inserted in a document, without creating artificial top headers.

* ``rich_markdown()``: This produces an output formatted with markdown syntax,
    with some modification, with the end result intended to be printed
    in colour in a console using Rich (https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich).
