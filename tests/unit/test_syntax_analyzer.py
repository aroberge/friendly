"""test_syntax_analyzer

The purpose of this file is to ensure that syntax errors are properly
identified; it is complementary to the use of catch_syntax_error.py
which imports various individual files, each having a separate syntax error and
triggering the entire exception analysis code of friendly-traceback, which
is more akin to an integration test.

By contrast, the current file does not trigger any exceptions, and focused
on testing a single module.  The goal is to ensure that any syntactically
invalid code is properly identified, and that no false positive is
generated by the analysis.


You may want to have a look at analyze_syntax.py and confirm that the following
is still accurate.

The analysis of SyntaxErrors is done via analyze_syntax.find_likely_cause()
which calls analyze_syntax._find_likely_cause(). The latter is called with
the following arguments:
    _find_likely_cause(source_lines, linenumber, message, offset)

Given that a SyntaxError exception will include something like

    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    or
    SyntaxError: a more specific "message"


_find_likely_cause() will proceed in three steps:

1. It will try to make use of the message included. Since the message can
   differ (sometimes just slightly) between Python versions, some tests
   below are done to confirm that messages are properly analyzed.
   This is done with a call to a series of specific functions which
   are given the "message", the line of code identified as problematic
   by Python and its corresponding linenumber. [The offset is ignored.]

2. Next, it will try to look at the content of the line flagged by Python as
   the last line it could analyze, going through a series of individual
   tests.  Here, only the last line of code is passed, which is broken
   down into a series of tokens prior to be sent to individual analyzers.
   [The message, linenumber and offset arguments are not used.]

3. Finally, it will look at the entire content, mostly focusing on checking
   if (), [], and {}, are properly matched and closed. In doing so, it might
   identify other errors along the way.
