# friendly-traceback
Aimed at Python beginners: replacing standard traceback by something easier to understand, translatable into various languages.

## Installation

```

## Documentation


[Full documentation available here](https://aroberge.github.io/friendly-traceback-docs/docs/html/)


## State of this project

Friendly-traceback is alpha. The current focus is on quickly increasing
the number of exceptions covered.  We strive to test the code as new additions
are made: everything included should work.  However, the code itself
could probably be refactored and could definitely be better documented.

## Contribute
