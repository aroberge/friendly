## Quick summary

Created with Python beginners in mind, but also useful for experienced users,
**friendly** replaces standard tracebacks
by something easier to understand, translatable into various languages. 
Currently, the information provided by **friendly** is only available
in two languages: English and French.

The additional information provided by **friendly** includes
`why()` a certain exception occurred,
`what()` it means, exactly `where()` it occurred including
the value of relevant variables, and
[more](https://aroberge.github.io/friendly-traceback-docs/docs/html/).


![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aroberge/friendly/master/why_1.png)
The screenshot above was taken on Windows. In some other operating systems
you might need to type `python3` instead of `python`: **friendly**
requires Python version 3.6 or newer.

**friendly** used to be called **friendly-traceback**.


## Installation

```
python -m pip install friendly
```

This needs to be done from a terminal.
In the command shown above,
`python` refers to whatever you need to type to invoke your
favourite Python interpreter.
It could be `python`, `python3`, `py -3.8`, etc.


For some special cases, including
using a specialized editor like [Mu](https://codewith.mu) that has its own way
of installing Python packages, please consult the documentation.
